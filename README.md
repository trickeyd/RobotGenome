Genome 2D extension for Robotlegs 2

This extension creates Robotlegs2 dependancy injection and mediation for Genome2D components. This could be useful for the overall structure of a Stage3d application or game.

You will need the following code:
Genome2D  :  https://github.com/pshtif/Genome2D
Robotlegs2  :  https://github.com/robotlegs/robotlegs-framework

It uses pixels4nickels signalCommandMap which can be found at:

I also used robotlegs2-starling-viewmap as a reference, which can be found here:
